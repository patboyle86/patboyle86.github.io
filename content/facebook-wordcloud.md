Summary: Using python to create a wordcloud from facebook posts

# Creating a wordcloud from Facebook posts
Recently people on Facebook have been posting wordclouds of their posts using a FB app. I thought this was cool, but I didn't really want to give an unknown app access to all my Facebook data. I'm in the process of learning python, so I thought it would be a fun project to try to do this in python.

The full code is located [here](github.com/patboyle86) for those who are interested, but I'll show the results below.

## All posts
Here is the wordcloud for all posts on my page.

Obviously there are a lot of happy birthday posts, my name, beer, etc. What about just my posts?

## My posts

This is kinda strange...why is "New" so frequent? After digging around the text for a bit I found that I wrote "New Haven" a lot. I decided to replace "New Haven" with "NewHaven" to get around this and made a new wordcloud.

Ok hmm, I guess I use the work "now" a lot...

What about just other people's posts on my wall?

## Other posts

Well, well, well...looks like the main reason people post on my wall is to wish me happy birthday. I'll combine "Happy Birthday" and "Happy birthday" into "HappyBirthday" to see what that does.

So that evens things out a bit. Still lots of birthday wishes. I bet this would show up in the post dates as well.

## Posts over time
Here are the number of posts per month for me and everyone else.

Oh, will ya look at that...seems like October is a popular month ;-)

Now I want to see post frequency over time.

Seems like I peaked in late 2011.

## Summary
This was a cool little project. There's other things I could do, like make a wordcloud for each year to see the change, filter just for swear words to see my favorites, but this is good for now. Hope you enjoyed it too!
