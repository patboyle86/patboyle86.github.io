    <h1>Creating a wordcloud from Facebook posts</h1>
<p>Recently people on Facebook have been posting wordclouds of their posts using a FB app. I thought this was cool, but I didn't really want to give an unknown app access to all my Facebook data. I'm in the process of learning python, so I thought it would be a fun project to try to do this in python.</p>
<p>The full code is located <a href="https://github.com/patboyle86/projects/blob/master/FBWallPosts.ipynb">here</a> for those who are interested, but I'll show the results below.</p>
<h2>All posts</h2>
<p>Here is the wordcloud for all posts on my page.
<img alt="All Posts" src="/images/allposts.png" /></p>
<p>Obviously there are a lot of happy birthday posts, my name, beer, etc. What about just my posts?</p>
<h2>My posts</h2>
<p><img alt="My Posts" src="/images/myposts.png" /></p>
<p>This is kinda strange...why is "New" so frequent? After digging around the text for a bit I found that I wrote "New Haven" a lot. I decided to replace "New Haven" with "NewHaven" to get around this and made a new wordcloud.</p>
<p><img alt="My Posts" src="/images/myposts2.png" /></p>
<p>Ok hmm, I guess I use the work "now" a lot...</p>
<p>What about just other people's posts on my wall?</p>
<h2>Other posts</h2>
<p><img alt="Other Posts" src="/images/otherposts.png" /></p>
<p>Well, well, well...looks like the main reason people post on my wall is to wish me happy birthday. I'll combine "Happy Birthday" and "Happy birthday" into "HappyBirthday" to see what that does.</p>
<p><img alt="Other Posts" src="/images/otherposts2.png" /></p>
<p>So that evens things out a bit. Still lots of birthday wishes. I bet this would show up in the post dates as well.</p>
<h2>Posts over time</h2>
<p>Here are the number of posts per month for me and everyone else.
<img alt="My Posts per month" src="/images/mypostsvstime.png" /><img alt="Other Posts per month" src="/images/otherpostsvstime.png" /></p>
<p>Oh, will ya look at that...seems like October is a popular month ;-)</p>
<p>Now I want to see post frequency over time.
<img alt="Posts vs Time" src="/images/allpostsvstime.png" /></p>
<p>Seems like I peaked in late 2011.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This was a cool little project. There's other things I could do, like make a wordcloud for each year to see the change, filter just for swear words to see my favorites, but this is good for now. Hope you enjoyed it too!</p>
